# Doggr: The Future of Images

Created by: Nick, Nancy, Daisy, Andy, and Kevin over the course of ~24 hours

## About

Since the dawn of civilization, man has yearned for self actualization. The transcendence of one's physical form, and all worldly burdens to which it is bound, may be the loftiest, and yea, most essential goal of mankind. The humble dog, man's best friend, has served as a shining example throughout the ages, of transcendent joy, the appreciation of the oneness of all things and the transience of our very lives. Now it is possible to live that fantasy, to hew ever closer to the canine ideal.

## Project Abstract

Using the power of modern computing, we have created a Chrome web extension which applies a dog face filter to all your photos. It also has a webpage that will directly add dog face filters to images.

## Setup
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the app

If you're using a virtualenv, activate it.

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then run the Flask app:

```
python app.py
```

Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and enjoy

Run the extension by going to chrome and adding the nicholascage folder as an extension
